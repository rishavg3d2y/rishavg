I am a first year PhD Student at the [School of Computing](https://www.quantumlah.org/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) funded by the [National Quantum Scholarship Scheme (NQSS)](https://nqo.sg/talent-development/scholarships-opportunities/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Divesh Aggarwal](https://sites.google.com/site/diveshhomepage/) and [Prof. Maciej Obremski](https://sites.google.com/view/maciejobremski).

My research interests lie in Theory and Foundations of Cryptography, Lattices and their applications in Post Quantum Cryptography, Quantum Computing and Quantum Information and Theoretical Computer Science in general. 

Previously I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, advised by [Dr. Nishanth Chandran](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nichandr/) and [Dr. Peeyush Kumar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pekumar/). Before that I spent one year as a Software Engineer at Microsoft IDC, in the Azure Specialized group.

I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, department of Computer Science and Engineering [(IITK-CSE)](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) with a Bachelor of Technology degree in CSE in 2021. I was fortunate to have [Prof. Raghunath Tewari](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rtewari/) as my academic advisor.
