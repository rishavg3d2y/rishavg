<span style="color:#8fba8a"> Hi there </span> :wave:,
====

I am a first year PhD Student at the School of Computing (SoC), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Prof. Divesh Aggarwal](https://sites.google.com/site/diveshhomepage/).

My research interests lie in Fine-grained Complexity Theory, Hardness of Approximation and Theoretical Computer Science in general. 


I graduated from Chennai Mathematical Institute, [(CMI)](https://www.cmi.ac.in/), in 2024.
